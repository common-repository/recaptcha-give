Quickly & easily integrate Google reCAPTCHA into your GiveWP donation forms to help prevent spam and fraudulent transactions.

== Description ==

You already know [GiveWP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/) is one of the highest rated, most downloaded, and best supported donation plugins for WordPress &mdash; so do spammers and credit card thieves. That's why we created reCAPTCHA for Give.

Donation forms are a favorite target for spam bots and fraudsters looking to test stolen credit card numbers. It can become a serious issue, affecting site performance &amp; lead to your payment gateway suspending or even closing your account. That's where [Google's reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) comes in.

= How reCAPTCHA works =

reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine &amp; adaptive challenges to keep malicious software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. Meanwhile, legitimate users will be able to login, make purchases, view pages, or create accounts and fake users will be blocked.

= reCAPTCHA may not be the best option =

reCAPTCHA may not be the best option for some sites. It could slow down the donation experience, look unsightly and may harm your donations more than benefit them. Luckily there's a great alternative to reCAPTCHA that supports GiveWP donation forms, [WordPress Zero Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/).

If you're still receiving high amounts of spam and fraudulent transactions, reCAPTCHA is a great option as your last line of defense.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire recaptcha-give folder to the */wp-content/plugins/* directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins screen (*Plugins > Installed Plugins*).
3. Visit the plugin setting to configure as needed (*Settings > reCAPTCHA for Give*).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do some people spam donation forms? =

The reason many fraudsters target donations (as opposed to other e-commerce solutions) is that there’s no cart to deal with as an additional hurdle.

With donations, there’s essentially a Credit card/Payment form on the site and so the bot/script that the fraudster creates is much simpler.

= What version of reCAPTCHA does this plugin support? =

**v2.** v3 support is coming soon.
